# Exercise 3 - Test DLP Policies

You are Joni Sherman, the Compliance Administrator for Contoso Ltd. tasked to configure the company's Microsoft 365 tenant for data loss prevention. Contoso Ltd. is a company offering driving instruction in the United States and you have configured DLP policies to make sure that sensitive customer information does not leave the organization. You decide to test your policies for correct functionality.

### Task 1 â€“ Test a DLP policy

In this exercise, you will test the DLP policy that scans for credit card information to make sure that your users are informed about the block action and allowed to override it.

1. Log into the Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account.

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, navigate to **https://outlook.office.com** and log into Outlook as **Joni Sherman**.

3. In the top-left corner, select **New message** and select **Megan Bowen** as the recipient in the **To** field.

4. In the **Subject** field, type **Credit card information** and in the **Body** type **Credit Card: MASTERCARD 5239681227023651**.

5. Above the **To** field you should now see a mail tip that reads **Policy tip: Your email message conflicts with a policy in your organization.**

6. Select **Send** and review the resulting message. It should allow you to override the block action.

You have successfully sent an e-mail including credit card information by providing a business justification.

### Task 2 - Test policy priority

In this exercise, you will test policy priority by sending an e-mail containing credit card information and driver's license numbers to make sure that the driver's license number DLP policy is applied and the block action without override is enforced.

1. You should still be logged into your Client 1 VM (LON-CL1) as the **lon-cl1\admin** account, and you should be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Joni Sherman**. 

2. In **Microsoft Edge**, the Office 365 Compliance Center tab should still be open. If so, select it and proceed to the next step. If you closed it, then in a new tab, navigate to **https://outlook.office.com**.

3. In the top-left corner, select **New message** and select **Megan Bowen** as the recipient in the **To** field.

4. In the **Subject** field, type **The requested user information** and in the **Body** type **Credit Card: MASTERCARD 5239681227023651** and **Drivers License: 2515644**.

5. Above the **To** field you should now see a mail tip that reads **Policy tip: Your email message conflicts with a policy in your organization.**

6. Select **Send** and review the resulting message. It should not allow you to override the block action.

You have verified that the more restrictive policy action is enforced if multiple types of sensitive information are present.
